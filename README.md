# TrainPlanning

A University project for 1st semester about making software that prints a table with the trainschedule and finding a route from a users input.

## Running the software

1. Run main.exe while having `Stationer.txt` in the same folder
2. When asked for a start destination enter a station name starting with a capital letter and the rest with lowercase letters
    1. With special letters like `æ` `ø` `å` please write `ae` `oe` `aa` respectively
3. Enter an end destination with the same limitations
4. Your route will now be displayed
